# NTIRE2025_RealWorld_Face_Restoration_IPCV
Factsheet repo for NTIRE 25 Real world image restoration

I used **Flux.1-dev-Controlnet-Upscale** for image restoration, setting the scaling factor to **1**. I am sharing all the materials used in the project. Everything was ran on Google Colab with Drive as storage.
